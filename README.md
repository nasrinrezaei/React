# React
## SPA
Before any framework each page needs a request to the server to be got and an HTML page with CSS and JS is returned to the userâ€™s browsers and this process is done for all links of pages. Furthermore, SPA applications like React are introduced in which efficient JS codes create and manipulate the dom, and just an HTML page once is got when a user clicks on a link to see a website, and JS links handle other changes of displaying the page and interacting with parts of it.
