# React
## SPA
Before any framework each page needs a request to the server to be got and an HTML page with CSS and JS is returned to the user’s browsers and this process is done for all links of pages. Furthermore, SPA applications like React are introduced in which efficient JS codes create and manipulate the dom, and just an HTML page once is got when a user clicks on a link to see a website, and JS links handle other changes of displaying the page and interacting with parts of it.
# Why React?

### .What is DOM?
DOM (document object model) is what the browser uses to display a web app and JS simply manipulates this DOM. 
### .Declarative vs Imperative
#### Imperative
Imperative programming is instructional and cares about the step-by-step process.
#### Declarative
Declarative programming is driven by the result and describing this end result rather than the step-by-step process of getting to the result.
### For example

```ruby
//Imperative 
function addArtistNameToBody() {
  const bodyTag = document.querySelector('body')
  const divTag = document.createElement('div')
  let h1Tag = document.createElement('h1')
  h1Tag.innerText = "Mitski"
  divTag.append(h1Tag)
  bodyTag.append(divTag)
}
```
```ruby
//Declarative
class Artist extends Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.name}</h1>
      </div>)
  }
}
```

The first is a prime example of the imperative search as it lays out each step of how the search function works and how it got to the result. This really illustrates the HOW and gives discrete ‘instructions’ to get to the desired result. In contrast, the declarative example focuses on purely the result and describes what this result will look like.
##.Differences between Declarative programming and Imperative one in changing DOM
In fact, in Imperative programming, you should tell JS what should do step by step to change the DOM in order for showing what you want as a result of an action of the user. Still, by Declarative programming it is React that decides what changes should be done to show what you want. Moreover, you just need to declare what the final state is and it finds the best way to do so. 
```

> Changing DOM is a really expensive operation and React does it beneficially.

### .Component Architecture
React has the idea of creating components for our web. Indeed, components are small and large parts of our app which are used to create our app. Generally, they are used in different sections of our project even in other projects. The point is that in React the components are simple JS functions which receive some data and inputs as props and return HTML inside of JS. In addition, components can be defined as functions or classes in React.
### Class component
```ruby
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```
```ruby
### Function Component
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
```
